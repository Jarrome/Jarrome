### Hi there 👋 I'm Yijun Yuan (元祎君) 

🌱 Currently:
* PostDoc in [MARS Tsinghua](https://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~marslab/#/), leading by [Prof. Hang Zhao](https://hangzhaomit.github.io/).

😄 I received my PhD at [Robotics group](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/robotics/) in Würzburg University with the supervising of [Prof. Andreas Nüchter](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/robotics/team/nuechter/).

🔭 My PhD focus is on the Dense SLAM with various sensors. 

🤔 Prior to my PhD, I also have experience on Rescue Robotics and Metrical & topological Mapping.
